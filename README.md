## Deployed Testing Link
[Click here or something.](https://grid-poc-theta.vercel.app/)

## Notes
I hate _hate_ this weird CSS thing Next.js does, but I was too tired to care enough to do something else about it.
- **TODO**: Replace with `stitches`.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
